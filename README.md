🧠 What is Unsupervised Machine Learning?
Unsupervised Machine Learning is a branch of machine learning where the model is trained on data without labeled outcomes.
Unlike supervised learning, where we teach the model using input-output pairs,
unsupervised learning only has input data and seeks to find patterns, structure, or relationships in the data.

📌 Key Goals
1. Clustering: Group similar data points together.
Example: Customer segmentation based on buying behavior.

2. Dimensionality Reduction: Reduce the number of features while preserving important information.
Example: Using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to visualize high-dimensional data.

3. Anomaly Detection: Identify rare or unusual data points.
Example: Fraud detection in financial transactions.

4. Association Rules: Discover interesting relationships between variables.
Example: Market basket analysis (if someone buys bread, they often buy butter).

🔍 Common Algorithms
Task	                   Algorithm	      Description
Clustering	             K-Means	        Partitions data into K clusters
                         DBSCAN	          Groups points with high density and detects noise
                         Agglomerative  	Builds nested clusters using a tree-like structure
Dimensionality Reduction PCA	            Projects data onto fewer dimensions while keeping variance
                         t-SNE	          Visualizes high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D
Anomaly Detection	       Isolation Forest	Detects outliers or unusual patterns
                         DBSCAN
